# Weather-App

Provides a GUI allowing the user to request weather data from the application.

Will provide feature list as they come up.

## Features
- Display weather, temperature, humidity, and wind speed of current time in specified city.
- Implements GUI to make requests.

### Stuff to add
- City name disambiguation
-- Might be able to do this from the search box if I can get an implementation that has you confirm which of several cities.
- 5 day forecast
- hourly updates

### Fix
- Currently, if "Moscow, Idaho" is entered into the box, it assumes Moscow, Russia. So I need someway to specify the city sooner than I thought.



##### Test case ideas
Moscow, Russia vs Moscow, Idaho
Kansas City, Kansas vs Kansas City, MO
Boise vs Boise City
